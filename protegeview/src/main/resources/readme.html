<h2>Query Debugger</h2>

<p>
    A tool for interactive finding of the most probable diagnosis by asking queries to the user.
    <p>
  The tool uses the HS-Tree algorithm presented in Reiter's theory of diagnosis from the first principles.
    <p>
  The implementation includes a version of Junker's QuickXPlain algorithm to calculate minimal conflict sets for HS-Tree.
